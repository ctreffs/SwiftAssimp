This is a  **thin** Swift wrapper around the popular and excellent [**Open Asset Import Library**](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) library.  
It provides a **swifty** and **typesafe** API. 

> Open Asset Import Library (short name: Assimp) is a portable Open Source library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform manner. The most recent version also knows how to export 3d files and is therefore suitable as a general-purpose 3D model converter.
> Loads 40+ 3D file formats into one unified and clean data structure.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine and provide a code example.

### üìã Prerequisites

* [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)
* [Open Asset Import Library (Assimp)](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
* [SwiftEnv](https://swiftenv.fuller.li/) for Swift version management - (optional)
* [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for linting - (optional)

### üíª Installing

Swift Assimp is available for all platforms that support [Swift 5.3](https://swift.org/) and higher and the [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

Extend your `Package.swift` file with the following lines or use it to create a new project.

For package manifests using the Swift 5.3+ toolchain use:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackageName",
    dependencies: [
        .package(name: "Assimp", url: "https://github.com/ctreffs/SwiftAssimp.git", from: "2.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: ["Assimp"])
    ]
)

```

Since it's a system library wrapper you need to install the assimp library (>=5.0.0) either via

```sh
brew install assimp
```

or 

```sh
apt-get install libassimp-dev
```

depending on you platform.


## üìù Code Example


```swift
import Assimp

let scene: AiScene = try AiScene(file: <path/to/model/file.obj>, 
                                 flags: [.removeRedundantMaterials, .genSmoothNormals]))

// get meshes
let meshes: [AiMesh] = scene.meshes

// get materials
let matrials: [AiMaterial] = scene.materials

// get the root node of the scene graph
let rootNode: [AiNode] = scene.rootNode

```

See the unit tests for more examples.

## üíÅ Help needed

This project is in an early stage and needs a lot of love.
If you are interested in contributing, please feel free to do so!

Things that need to be done are, among others:

- [ ] Wrap more assimp functions and types
- [ ] Support for [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) packaging
- [ ] Support for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) packaging
- [ ] Write some additional tests to improve coverage

## üôè Original code

Since Swift Assimp is merely a wrapper around [**assimp**](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) it obviously depends on it.       
Support them if you can!
