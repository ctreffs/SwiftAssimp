/// Helper structure to describe an embedded texture
///
/// Normally textures are contained in external files but some file formats embed them directly in the model file.
/// There are two types of embedded textures:
/// 1. Uncompressed textures.
/// The color data is given in an uncompressed format.
/// 2. Compressed textures stored in a file format like png or jpg.
/// The raw file bytes are given so the application must utilize an image decoder (e.g. DevIL) to get access to the actual color data.
///
/// Embedded textures are referenced from materials using strings like "*0", "*1", etc. as the texture paths (a single asterisk character followed by the zero-based index of the texture in the aiScene::mTextures array).
